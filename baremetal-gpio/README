2. Analog Servo.
3. Adafruit SSD1306 128x32 SPI OLED Display.
4. serial USB cable.

The following 11 tests are included: ( see below for tests summary )
1. uart test
2. led test
3. button test
4. pwm led test
5. i2c lcd test
6. tongsong
7. servo
8. spi oled test
9. ddr test
a. mmc test
b. dmac test

Steps to test gpio:

   \rm -rf rkbin
   git clone https://github.com/rockchip-linux/rkbin.git
   make clean
   make test
   ./mksdcardimg.sh
   Plugin sdcard to PC.
   sudo dd if=./sdcard.img of=/dev/sda bs=4096 conv=notrunc,fsync
   Eject sdcard.
   Plugin sdcard to rockpi4b.
   Connect rockpi4b gpio pin  8 to serial USB cable TX ( white ).
   Connect rockpi4b gpio Pin 10 to serial USB cable RX ( green ).
   Connect rockpi4b gpio pin  9 to serial USB cable ground ( black ).
   Type "script ~/outputfile.txt" on PC.
   Plugin serial USB cable to PC.
   Type "sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 1500000" on PC.
   Power on rockpi4b.
   It should display the test menu with 11 test items on PC.
   After tests done, hit q to exit tests.
   Power off rockpi4b.
   Unplug serial USB cable from PC.
   Type "exit" on PC.
   vi ~/outputfile.txt

   This test is to test uart tx and rx.
   Connect gpio pin  8 to serial USB cable TX.
   Connect gpio pin 10 to serial USB cable RX.
   Connect gpio pin 39 to serial USB cable ground.
   Enter a sentence and hit return key.

2. led test.
   This test will blink led 5 times.
   Connect gpio pin 32 to led control.
   Connect gpio pin  2 to led 5V.
   Connect gpio pin  9 to led ground.

3. button test.
   Push button 10 times. The led will on/off 10 times.
   Connect gpio pin 32 to led control.
   Connect gpio pin  2 to led 5V.
   Connect gpio pin  9 to led ground.
   Connect gpio pin 23 to button control.
   Connect gpio pin  4 to button 5V.
   Connect gpio pin  6 to button ground.

4. pwm led test.
   This test will dim led 10 times.
   Connect gpio pin 13 to led control. ( pwm 1 ).
   Connect gpio pin  2 to led 5V.
   Connect gpio pin  9 to led ground.

5. i2c lcd test.
   This test will change lcd backlight color for 5 cycles.
   Then it will display two sentences on lcd display.
   Connect gpio pin  3 to lcd display SDA. ( i2c-7 ).
   Connect gpio pin  5 to lcd display SCL.
   Connect gpio pin  2 to lcd display 5V.
   Connect gpio pin  9 to lcd display ground.

6. tongsong.
   This test will generate song using buzzer.
   Connect gpio pin 13 to buzzer control. ( pwm 1 )
   Connect gpio pin  2 to buzzer 5V.
   Connect gpio pin  9 to buzzer ground.

7. servo.
   This test will turn servo 45 degree - 90 degree - 45 degree - 0 degree etc.
   Connect gpio pin 13 to servo control. ( pwm 1 )
   Connect gpio pin  2 to servo 5V.
   Connect gpio pin  9 to servo ground.

8. spi oled test.
   This test will show some ascii characters on the oled display.
   Connect gpio pin 32 to oled display DC.  ( spi-2 )
   Connect gpio pin 24 to oled display CS.
   Connect gpio pin 19 to oled display TX.
   Connect gpio pin 23 to oled display CLK.

9. ddr test.
   This test will write random data to ddr address from 0x10000 to 0x7ffffff
   Then read ddr address from 0x10000 to 0x7ffffff compare to expected data.
   It will stop when any data mismatch.

a. mmc test.
   This test will read sdcard lba 32768.
   Then read sdcard lba 6283260.
   Then write incremental data to sdcard lba 6283260.
   Then read data from sdcard lba 6283260.
