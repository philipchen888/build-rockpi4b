    This example attempts to format a clean Mifare Classic 1K card as
    an NFC Forum tag (to store NDEF messages that can be read by any
    NFC enabled Android phone, etc.)

    Note that you need the baud rate to be 115200 because we need to print
    out the data and read from the card at the same time!
